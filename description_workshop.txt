[h1] MooMoo's Yoyo Revamp [/h1]

*IMPORTANT! If you are viewing this on the TmodLoader mod browser, it is reccomended you go to the steam page instead, for better readability.
I'm not sure why, but the mod browser isn't using the mod description. Instead, it's using the steam description.

This mod adds a large amount of accessories, Yoyos, new mechanics, and changes to Vanilla Yoyos.

[b] Adds over 30 more Yoyos, each with special crafting recipes and effects [/b]

Purchase the Ability Ring from the Skeleton Peddler for 20 gold to allow yoyos to use special effects.

[u]- Changes To Vanilla Yoyos [/u]
    Each Yoyo's stats have been buffed, including lifetime,
    speed, and range
    Yoyos have special particles

[u]- Unique Accessories[/u]

   [b] Rings [/b]
     [list][*]Some rings make Yoyos emit particles and light
     [*]Some rings add certain functions to Yoyos[/list]
   [b]Tricks[/b]
     [list][*]Do special things, usually creating extra yoyos that only swirl around the player[/list]
   [b]Drill Casings[/b]
     [list][*]Yoyos can drill through blocks[/list]
   [b]New Yoyo Gloves[/b]
   [list]
     [*]Support Gloves : Increases yoyos made by the Yoyo Glove
     [*]Yoyo Gloves : Function similarly to the regular Yoyo Glove, but have small differences[/list]

[b]- 8 new accessory slots[/b]
[list]
    [*]2 String Slots
    [*]2 Ring Slots
    [*]2 Glove Slots
    [*]Drill Slot
    [*]Counterweight Slot [/list]

[b] -= Many changes to Vanilla =- [/b]

[u] Reccomended that you use Achievement Mod when it ports to 1.4.4, as this mod adds several new and unique achievements. [/u]

This mod's focus is not entirely to be balanced, but to give a more enjoyable experience with using yoyos.
Some things may be tweaked later to help balance it out a little.

[b] I will likely be adding small updates to the mod, and maybe even a few larger ones, but being that this was the first mod I ever made, I'd like to move on to other stuff.[/b]
