This mod adds a large amount of accessories, Yoyos, new mechanics, and changes to Vanilla Yoyos.

Adds over 30 more Yoyos, each with special crafting recipes and effects

Purchase the Ability Ring from the Skeleton Peddler for 20 gold to allow yoyos to use special effects.

    speed, and range

-= Many changes to Vanilla =-

Reccomended that you use Achievement Mod when it ports to 1.4.4, as this mod adds several new and unique achievements.

This mod's focus is not entirely to be balanced, but to give a more enjoyable experience with using yoyos.
Some things may be tweaked later to help balance it out a little.

I will likely be adding small updates to the mod, and maybe even a few larger ones, but being that this was the first mod I ever made, I'd like to move on to other stuff.

If you'd like to view the change notes for the most recent larger update, (0.1.2.0 / May 29th), please visit the workshop page for this mod, as all the info is posted there.
